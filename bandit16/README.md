Bandit Level 15 &rarr; Level 16
===============================

Level Goal
----------

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the
password of the current level to **port 30001 on localhost** using SSL
encryption.

**Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign\_eof
and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’
and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…**

Commands you may need to solve this level
-----------------------------------------

ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s\_client, nmap

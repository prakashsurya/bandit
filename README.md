The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach the
basics needed to be able to play other wargames. **If you notice
something essential is missing or have ideas for new levels, please let
us know!**

Note for beginners
------------------

This game, like most other games, is organised in levels. You start at
Level 0 and try to “beat” or “finish” it. Finishing a level results in
information on how to start the next level. The pages on this website
for “Level &lt;X&gt;” contain information on how to start level X from
the previous level. E.g. The page for [Level 1][Level 1] has information
on how to gain access from [Level 0][Level 0] to [Level 1][Level 1]. All
levels in this game have a page on this website, and they are all linked
to from the sidemenu on the left of this page.

You will encounter many situations in which you have no idea what you
are supposed to do. **Don’t panic! Don’t give up!** The purpose of this
game is for you to learn the basics. Part of learning the basics, is
reading a lot of new information.

There are several things you can try when you are unsure how to
continue:

-   First, if you know a command, but don’t know how to use it, try the
    **manual** ([man page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page)) by
    entering “**man &lt;command&gt;**” (without the quotes). e.g. if you
    know about the “ls” command, type: man ls. The “man” command also
    has a manual, try it. Press q to quit the man command.
-   Second, if there is no man page, the command might be a **shell
    built-in**. In that case use the “**help &lt;X&gt;**” command. E.g.
    help cd
-   Also, your favorite **search-engine** is your friend. Learn how to
    use it! I recommend [Google](http://www.google.com).
-   Lastly, if you are still stuck, you can [join us on IRC][IRC]

You’re ready to start! Begin with [Level 0][Level 0], linked at the left
of this page. Good luck!
